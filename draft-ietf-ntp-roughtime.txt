1.  Introduction

   Time synchronization is essential to Internet security as many
   security protocols and other applications require synchronization
   [RFC738] [@MCBG].  Unfortunately widely deployed protocols such as
   the Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC5905] lack essential security
   features, and even newer protocols like Network Time Security (NTS)
   [RFC8915] lack mechanisms to ensure that the servers behave
   correctly.  Furthermore clients may lack even a basic idea of the
   time, creating bootstrapping problems.  Roughtime uses a list of keys
   and servers to resolve this issue.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol Overview

   Roughtime is a protocol for rough time synchronization that enables
   clients to provide cryptographic proof of server malfeasance.  It
   does so by having responses from servers include a signature over a
   value derived from a nonce in the client request.  This provides
   cryptographic proof that the timestamp was issued after the server
   received the client's request.  The derived value included in the
   server's response is the root of a Merkle tree which includes the
   hash of the client's nonce as the value of one of its leaf nodes.
   This enables the server to amortize the relatively costly signing
   operation over a number of client requests.  Single server mode: At
   its most basic level, Roughtime is a one round protocol in which a
   completely fresh client requests the current time and the server
   sends a signed response.  The response includes a timestamp and a
   radius used to indicate the server's certainty about the reported
   time.  For example, a radius of 1,000,000 microseconds means the
   server is absolutely confident that the true time is within one
   second of the reported time.  The server proves freshness of its
   response as follows.  The client's request contains a nonce which the
   server incorporates into its signed response.  The client can verify
   the server's signatures and - provided that the nonce has sufficient
   entropy - this proves that the signed response could only have been
   generated after the nonce.

4.  The Guarrentee

   A Roughtime server guarantees that a response to a query sent at t1,
   received at t2, and with timestamp t3 has been created between the
   transmission of the query and its reception.  If t3 is not within
   that interval, a server inconsistency may be detected and used to
   impeach the server.  The propagation of such a guarantee and its use
   of type synchronization is discussed in (#integration-into-ntp).  No
   delay attacker may affect this: they may only expand the interval
   between t1 and t2, or of course stop the measurement in the first
   place.

5.  Message Format

   Roughtime messages are maps consisting of one or more (tag, value)
   pairs.  They start with a header, which contains the number of pairs,
   the tags, and value offsets.  The header is followed by a message
   values section which contains the values associated with the tags in
   the header.  Messages MUST be formatted according to Figure TODO as
   described in the following sections.

   Messages MAY be recursive, i.e. the value of a tag can itself be a
   Roughtime message.

   !--- 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

   !--- ## Data types ### int32 An int32 is a 32 bit signed integer.  It
   is serialized least significant byte first in sign-magnitude
   representation with the sign bit in the most significant bit.  The
   negative zero value (0x80000000) MUST NOT be used and any message
   with it is syntactically invalid and MUST be ignored. ### uint32 A
   uint32 is a 32 bit unsigned integer.  It is serialized with the least
   significant byte first. ### uint64 A uint64 is a 64 bit unsigned
   integer.  It is serialized with the least significant byte first. ###
   Tag Tags are used to identify values in Roughtime messages.  A tag is
   a uint32 but may also be listed in this document as a sequence of up
   to four ASCII characters [RFC20].  ASCII strings shorter than four
   characters can be unambiguously converted to tags by padding them
   with zero bytes.  For example, the ASCII string "NONC" would
   correspond to the tag 0x434e4f4e and "PAD" would correspond to
   0x00444150.  Note that when encoded into a message the ASCII values
   will be in the natural bytewise order. ### Timestamp A timestamp is a
   uint64 count of seconds since the Unix epoch in UTC. ## Header All
   Roughtime messages start with a header.  The first four bytes of the
   header is the uint32 number of tags N, and hence of (tag, value)
   pairs.  The following 4_(N-1) bytes are offsets, each a uint32.  The
   last 4_N bytes in the header are tags.  Offsets refer to the
   positions of the values in the message values section.  All offsets
   MUST be multiples of four and placed in increasing order.  The first
   post-header byte is at offset 0.  The offset array is considered to
   have a not explicitly encoded value of 0 as its zeroth entry.  The
   value associated with the ith tag begins at offset[i] and ends at
   offset[i+1]-1, with the exception of the last value which ends at the
   end of the message.  Values may have zero length.  Tags MUST be
   listed in the same order as the offsets of their values and MUST also
   be sorted in ascending order by numeric value.  A tag MUST NOT appear
   more than once in a header. # Protocol Details
